Dotfiles
==========

My dotfiles commonly used in an UNIX environment

Install
=======
bash install.sh

Notes
=====
- Install JSHint (npm, Syntastic)
- Use VIM-Version 7.4 or higher with python-support
- Since vim-airline needs an adapted fontset (otherwise VIMs statusbar appears glitchy)
  ... either use prepatched fontset (https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts)
  ... or patch your very own fontset (https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/fontpatching.html)
